Dear ________ sir.

I hope you are doing well. I am Kunal, a second-year Electronics and engineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I am sending this email, to seek an internship opportunity to work with you.As a person, I am altruistic and agile, keen to implement my learnings to solve real-world problems.

Recently I did three Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence(basic) Courses from coursera which were made by IBM through which I was able to learn basics of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning(Simple Regression,K nearest neighbour,clustering,etc).All the three courses were very insightful for me and on that basis i have made a Rainfall prediction in Australia project i would like to show it the link is given at the end of the mail , I have also done a Externship Program of SmartInternz Where I learned About all Data Science Techniques Machine Learning Algorithms and Deep Learning Algorithms and I am Currently Working as Data Science Intern in Quickheal Antivirus Company.

However, I am want to explore this field more deeply and working under you would be the best way to do it. Your research paper titled "I have to write the research paper topic for the regarding professor" was an eye-opener for me as it made me realise that though the relevance of the content is a key factor in determining how a website ranks in the organic search result, it becomes crucial only when the consumer is far ahead in the consumer journey. I am very much keen to work with you and even if you require me to learn any new skill I am ready for it too. I just want to learn and grow as an individual under you.

In case of any opportunity available please do consider my application and will be very much thankful to have an opportunity to work with you.
