This lecture explained about why american wood companies will eventually 
seek ecocertifcation.There are following 3 main reason

First of all, All people dont treat all the advertising same, as they are 
good at identifying those companies whose products are claimed by good by the
manufacturing companies as well as the certfication agencies.Thus eco-friendly
americans are mostly likely to buy the eco-friendly products certified by the 
internationally reputated organization

Secondly,It is true that american consumers are concerned about price but if 
price difference between the product is not significant about 2-3% they
neglect the price factor and as the day are passing by americans are becoming
more concerned about their environment and they are taking positive steps towards
natural life conservation and protection

Thirdly,as mentioned in above paragraphs American customers are instrested in 
in ecocertified products and if american compaines start capturing those customers 
they can help to attract foreign compaines to invest into american market helping
to raise american economy and preserving their environment

All in all , american compaines should start seeking eco-certification to gain more 
customer , perserving their environment and to attract foreign compaines to 
invest into american market helping to raise american economy
